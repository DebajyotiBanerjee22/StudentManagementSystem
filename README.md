📝 How to Run
Open the project in NetBeans.
Ensure MySQL server is running and database studentdb is created.
Execute the SQL from SQL stmnt Student Database.txt.
Add the mysql-connector-java-9.3.0.jar in lib/ to your NetBeans project classpath.
Run Main.java.

# ************The .png and .pdf and .txt is packaged in Zip folder**************
# for ease I have also provided the mysql-connector-j-9.3.0.jar file seperately download it and add it in your library with the latest jdk version 24, it also works with jdk 17, I have use Apache Netbeans 21, you may use your familiear ide.
